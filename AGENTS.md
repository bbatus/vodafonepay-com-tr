# Website Reverse-Engineer Template

## What This Is
A reusable template for reverse-engineering any website into a clean, modern Next.js codebase using AI coding agents. The Next.js + shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 base is pre-scaffolded — just run `/clone-website <url1> [<url2> ...]`.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict)
- **UI:** shadcn/ui (Radix primitives, Tailwind CSS v4, `cn()` utility)
- **Icons:** Lucide React (default — will be replaced/supplemented by extracted SVGs)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with oklch design tokens
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Start dev server
- `npm run build` — Production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint check
- `npm run typecheck` — TypeScript check
- `npm run check` — Run lint + typecheck + build

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any`
- Named exports, PascalCase components, camelCase utils
- Tailwind utility classes, no inline styles
- 2-space indentation
- Responsive: mobile-first

## Design Principles
- **Pixel-perfect emulation** — match the target's spacing, colors, typography exactly
- **No personal aesthetic changes during emulation phase** — match 1:1 first, customize later
- **Real content** — use actual text and assets from the target site, not placeholders
- **Beauty-first** — every pixel matters

## MOST IMPORTANT NOTES
- When launching Claude Code agent teams, ALWAYS have each teammate work in their own worktree branch and merge everyone's work at the end, resolving any merge conflicts smartly since you are basically serving the orchestrator role and have full context to our goals, work given, work achieved, and desired outcomes.
- After editing `AGENTS.md`, run `bash scripts/sync-agent-rules.sh` to regenerate platform-specific instruction files.
- After editing `.claude/skills/clone-website/SKILL.md`, run `node scripts/sync-skills.mjs` to regenerate the skill for all platforms.
- **After any large component or code change** (new component, non-trivial refactor, new collection/route), run a SonarQube scan before committing/pushing:
  1. `docker compose -f tools/sonarqube/docker-compose.yml up -d` (starts SonarQube on `http://localhost:9002` if not already running)
  2. `SONAR_TOKEN=<token> scripts/sonar-scan.sh all` (or `web` / `cms` to scope it) — generate a token once from the SonarQube UI (My Account > Security)
  3. Fix everything the scan reports before commit/push. The script exits non-zero if any open issue remains.
  - This is a local/dev-only stack, not part of `docker-compose.yml`'s prod services — never expose it, never bundle it into a deploy.
- **After any change to a Dockerfile or a dependency** (package.json/package-lock.json), run `scripts/trivy-scan.sh all` (Trivy — covers both container image and dependency/SCA scanning) and fix everything it reports before commit/push. Requires the app/cms images to be built first (`docker compose -p vodafonepaycomtr up -d --build app cms`).
- Both Dockerfiles use `node:24-alpine` (not `-slim`) specifically because Trivy found the Debian-slim base carried far more OS-level CVEs; the runner stages also strip `npm`/`npx`/`corepack` since they're never invoked at runtime and their bundled deps carry their own CVEs. Don't revert either of these without re-running `scripts/trivy-scan.sh images` to confirm the tradeoff.
- `npm test` / `npm run test:coverage` exist in both the root project and `cms/` (Vitest). Keep coverage reasonably close to what's there now (~50% root, CMS access/hooks/collections near-100%) — write tests for new logic (access control, hooks, data transforms) rather than letting coverage silently regress.
